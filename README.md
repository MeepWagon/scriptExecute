# scriptExecute
My first roblox game using Rojo (A tool for coding roblox games with VS Code) and Roact (A UI Framework built similar to React). This is a highly volatile game that allows users to insert scripts in a textbox UI object, running them server using the loadstring() function (Basically, you can break everything and kick everyone if you know Lua).
